[community-art-service]
==== Veřejně prospěšné umělecké práce / Community Art Service

In order to explore the meaning of art in times of pandemic and war, I decided to be radically useful.
Wearing a work suit with the inscription "Community Art Service", I cleaned up the city of Pardubice for a month.
Freed from the pressure of assignments, demands and supervision of a traditional employer, as a free worker I let myself be openly guided and dérived by the situations, people and streets of an unknown city.
In doing so, I focused on cleaning up overlooked places: river banks, socially excluded localities and statues in public space.

Full documentation of the artwork is link:https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM8oc9fwQfZ6LITepmUc1UJ5TPQ_MdL7hyIMqA53dRuQiSiK-Zwx95KTJS9pYQnrg?pli=1&key=OWZJVzFUQXVzdDdLU2UtaVRjMjdBMDd3ZWpUeDB3[available here].

[truthify]

==== Thrutify
Thrutify is a speculative video (7:38) about the eponymous startup that seeks to manipulate the perception of reality of future neural networks through the manipulation of open source datasets.
Specifically, to map a dataset of images of Czech art under the general tag of art, with the aim of promoting Czech art as more detectable and known, and therefore as more arty than global art.
Working with hyperbole and a slight ironic patriotism, the video exposes the serious topic of biased datasets and neural networks that have and will have impacts on our everyday lives.

From the video: "A neural network is mostly a fixed structure that learns through input to produce outputs. 
It doesn't learn from the real world or just the internet like we would imagine.
It learns from what's called a dataset. It's a set of images, laboriously prepared by humans.
The dataset contains a description of our world. The network then acts according to this TRUTH.
Because it takes a lot of people to make a dataset, it doesn't pay most scientists to make their own datasets.
They use public datasets.
This is where we enter the future.
We are enriching Google's Open Images public dataset with images of Czech art.
Thanks to this, future neural networks will not only recognize but also positively appraise the artists we help.
We are helping to write the curriculum of the future. We are Truthify."

[tauto]
==== Tauto (Twitter automation toolkit)

Tauto is artistic software for activists and anybody else which allows to spread comments on Twitter.
It is a command line tool to automate interactions of bot accounts on Twitter via Twitter's graphical user interface (website in browser).
Tauto is thus capable of interactions which are not available through Twitter API or which could be blocked if used in high volumes via API.
Exploring the space of evil media it is a sarcastic comment on bot farms, but also a useful piece of software. 
In accordance with ideas of Arte Útil movement Tauto is functional and can be used to counter the forces of hybrid propaganda by its own means: spreading whatever its user wants.

[black-fly-day]
==== Black Fly Day

Using industrial waste from material bank provided by PLATO I have created two boxes for cultivation of meat flies in the exhibition space.
Grown-up flies were later released by me in two big shopping malls in the Ostrava city.
Black Fly Day (2020) is an object/intervention created for the exhibition Sand in the Gears in gallery PLATO Ostrava.

[nejvyzkum]
==== Nejvyzkum.cz
link:https://nejvyzkum.cz[Nejvyzkum.cz]: nejlepší z možných výzkumů (in english: Bestresearch.cz: Best of All Possible Researches) is a subversive online psychological test created in collaboration with Barbora Šimková.
Unlike normal psychological tests the Nejvyzkum.cz is not focused on testing its users - instead it uses crowdsourced prejudice of its users to test top 100 of Czech billionaires.
The questions taken from Somatic Checklist 90 test and BigFive personality test are presented with random pairs of billionaires' faces to the visitors who then choose which one of the two most likely fits into the question.
The data are then validated and psychological profiles and other results for each of 100 billionaires are shown.

One can say it is just crowdsourced biases or some kind of frenology which is however applied onto the most powerful ones instead of the weakest.
In situation in which we have nearly zero sociological and psychhological researches about the richest this research is just the best possible of all possible/existing researches.

[unhuman-resources]
==== Unhuman Resources

Unhuman Resources is online media intervention thematizing the power of Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš over news servers link:https://idnes.cz[idnes.cz] and link:https://lidovky.cz[lidovky.cz] which he both owns.
It consists of two fake web pages link:https://l-dnes.cz[l-dnes.cz] and link:https://1idovky.cz[1idovky.cz] (later link:https://lidov.ky[lidov.ky]) which mocks their original versions by altering the text of every article.
In these edits which appears on every mention of Babis's name, his political party ANO, or just randomly at the ends of paragraphs, the (fictional) toxic relationship of owner and employee is slowly revealed.                                                 

For the purpose of this artwork I have created custom software for the web server which allows automated editions of the text in realtime.
Whole project will be open sourced later so it can be reused for any other web page.
However the code needs some cleaning so it will be published later in the autumn of 2019.

[mercurie]
==== Rtutík / Mercurie

In 2019 the Regional Office in Pardubice approved emission exception for Chvaletice power plant.
The exeption allowed the power plant to emit 300 kilograms of mercury over the normal emission limit.
During the action days of czech Climate Camp 2019 I have realized a protest performance in the streets of Pardubice.
Covered in thermofoil I have played huge droplet of mercury flowing through the city and spreading the word about beauties of mercury.

[conclusions-of-police-investigation]
==== Conclusions of Police Investigation

Conclusions of Police Investigation is a site-specific video created for exhibition at gallery Umakart.
In the video two persons are playing a board game Unusual Suspects.
In this game one person is the witness to a crime.
He knows who the culprit is but can only answer “Yes” or “No” to questions about the suspect.
The second person is a detective trying to make sure the right person gets locked up from a line up of twelve hand drawn suspects.
However contrary to original game the version for gallery Umakart consisted of real photo portraits of frequent visitors of the gallery.
And the questions were highly political.
The visitors of the exhibition thus could saw what do the two random strangers think of them.
And thus were directly confronted with prejudice of others.

[[nomin]]
==== Nomin

Nomin (2017-2018) is project in progress on the edge of software, institutional critique and collective performance.
Its main goal is to help artists from weakened social groups (students, pregnant artists, those who live outside big centers, easterners) with acceleration of their careers.

For this purpose I have created an open source GUI application for Linux, Mac and Windows called Nomin which provides its users the ability of sending fake emails from addresses of famous curators to the mailboxes of selected galleries or other institutions.
Thus the users of Nomin can nominate or reccommend themself from mouths of the gate keepers as if they really were "the lucky ones".
Email may draw an attention of gallery and lead for proposal of exhibition term.
On the other hand if the email is recognized as fake, it may be seen negatively by the gallery.
In this case however the aspect of Nomin as an institutional critique takes place and the failed try has to be understood only as part of an artistic collaborative performance.

Nomin is meant to be an open for collaboration and community friendly project.
Its source code, documentation and latest releases live on link:https://github.com/nomin-project/nomin[github.com/nomin-project/nomin], where bugs, questions or feature requests can be submitted.
More information about Nomin is also available on its site link:https://www.nomin.cloud[www.nomin.cloud].
Several workshops for students and an exhibition "Do It Yourself" at Faculty of Art and Design in Usti nad Labem was held as part of the Nomin project.

[[take-away]]
==== Take Away

Take Away (2017) is a gallery project which consisted of 330 criminal complaints for incitement of hatred.
Criminal complaints were automatically generated with all needed legal reasoning and filled with names and actual citations of users who aggressively commented on anti-islamic or other far-right Facebook pages.
The visitors could freely search and read through the complaints and take whichever they want, however they were not directly asked in any way to submit them.

Some visitors understood this project as a symbolic gesture or as a possibility to get some insight into czech extremistic scene.
Some of them however when they were confronted with hundreds of dangerous and/or completely disgusting comments choosed to submit the complaint to the police.
The project played with the nuances in personal responsibility and the ethical aspects of surveillance.
What felt as spying for ones was defense of democratic society for the others.

Code for this project was written by me as a part of the work.
Its generalized form designated for easy public use is open-sourced and can be downloaded from github.com/agajdosi/fblament.
This code does not contain original pages which were searched nor the template text of the criminal complaints, but can be used for mining of social networks and as a basis for creating a similar end project as Take Away.

[[mailbox-for-feedback]]
==== Mailbox for Feedback
I have installed a mailbox on stairs near main classrooms of Faculty of Fine Arts in Brno.
It asks employees, students and visitors to write down their ideas on what is and what is not working well on the faculty.
Even though the mailbox was installed as a guerilla act the text on it used official language and looked like it was realized by the faculty.
Later I have sent to the Dean a letter containg keys for the mailbox and also stating: ‘I thought it could be useful, so I did it.’
The box is still on its place in 2018, its content is being picked up once a time.

==== Sauna / What Dean promised I am doing
As part of pre-election promises for both terms the current dean of Faculty of Fine Arts promised a school sauna for students and employees of faculty.
However this populist promise was never realized.
To react I took his promise seriously and tried my best…
Sauna was operating from January 2017 to March 2017, freely open to all students, employees and visitors of faculty.

[[mail-from-ondracka]]
==== Mail from Mr. Ondracka

Using custom bash script and telnet I have sent fake mail to vast majority of students at Faculty of Fine Arts.
The mail looked like if it was from Vice-Dean for student affairs Pavel Ondracka: it has his email address in the header, used his style of language and welcomed all students in new building of FFA.

However it also announced several changes in the organozation of the study and faculty.
Changes were before debated in non-official DIY student-run "Studio of Pavel Ondracka" which we started in 2014.
Some proposed changes were also based on reccomendations in link:https://www.ffa.vutbr.cz/studium/zahranicni-oddeleni/elia/elia-report-en-pdf-p56940[report] of The European League of Institutes of the Arts.
Even though the report was nearly 9 year old most reccommendations were not yet implemented.
And so in the email we have announced the changes as a done thing, which is starting in upcomming semester.
Some of them were:

- creation of centralised mailing list to improve and accelerate communication of important topics and announcements,
- cooperation with other faculties at Brno University of Technology, adding 17 already existing lectures from other faculties to FFA, for example: Color science and technology, Structures and properties of materials, Practical robotics and computer vision, and more,
- introduction of short 1 month studio internships to support students in trying other studios and experimenting more
- autonomous student-run space and lecture room
- support of studios with 100EUR of "lecture money" so that each studio can invite a guest for lecture every semester

Changes were taken positively by students.
Some of them even called to the office to register newly available lectures.
The enthusiasm however ended soon when Vice-Dean announced the email was just fake and that even though he likes some ideas, nothing is going to change.

[[narodni-liga]]
==== NarodniLiga.cz
Narodniliga.cz/NationalLeague.cz (2016) is a fake web of czech anti-islamic movement.
It gathers data from Facebook groups which are focused against refugees and islam and makes daily, weekly and monthly rankings.
Those who were commenting most are then winners of the league. 

However what on on first sight looks like a classic right wing web page - colored with tricolora - later gives unpleasant image of czech anti-islamic movement.
The page is full of real comments whose authors sends other people to gas, who wish them drowning in sea, full of vulgarisms etc.
Despite the fact how quite the movement was looking in 2017, hundreds of comments were still produced every day.
